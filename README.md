## Purpose of Next
As a single mother, being interrupted while I'm working is okay the first two or three times, but once it surpasses that I find that my productivity/motivation begin to fade.  

I spoke to a dear friend of mine who thinks the world of me and she suggested that I create a "What's Next" booklet for him.  She explained it and I imagined it as follows:


## Models & Controllers
When I'm "done during school"
    - Sometimes my son is finished during class, and he has 15 minutes of asynchronous time which has turned out to be a 15 minute break that I believe he thoroughly needs and deserves.  However, I wish he was taking intentional breaks with clarity of what he was going to do instead of always feeling like he needs to come to be to announce that he is finished.  He can do the next thing, without interrupting me, and let me know he did it.
    -  I want this to be a list of activities that will help him focus better.  Maybe it will eventually grow into tracking points for rewards
When I'm "done after school"
    - Yes, my son plays video games.  It's how he stays connected to his aunts and his uncles and his cousins, and hopefully some friends.  However, I don't like that it's the "only" option for him to socialize or play.  But we are in a global pandemic so it's a little okay that he does this.  But I want to incorporate a better evening routine for him, and this is where I would like for that to live.
When I'm "stuck in class work"
    - This section is usually about a missing link that is difficult to find or the sign-in information for him.  It's potentially sensitive information so I want to make sure that this piece is secure.
